Herodotus is a web app that will allow users to search for films based on any time/place throughout world history.

#Introduction to Herodotus
Those interested in learning/teaching about history can create instant timelines by searching for films set in any particular place or time throughout world history. For example, you may want to find movies set in Ancient Rome, or maybe 19th century China... a chronologically order list of movies can be easily displayed.

Herodotus can be leveraged as a tool to help students/learners visualize history before they get into the more dry aspects of traditional education (e.g. textbooks, lectures, etc.). Furthermore, it serves as a means of exploring the historical context of events and figures, beyond the rote memorization of names and dates.

It is encouraged for users to discuss the historical veracity depicted in the films, through Herodotus' individual comments sections. Each film has its own public comments section, as well as private notes section. Therefore, the user is encouraged (but not required) to log in/register.

#Building Herodotus
This was a project made by three students at an intensive programming school in Toronto, Canada. Each of us had been programming for six weeks before the beginning of this project, and we had only a few weeks to complete it. Through hard work, perseverance, and around a zillion git commits, we finally finished the first version, and deployed it onto Heroku. It is our intention to continue working on Herodotus as time permits, as we believe that this could become a substantial asset to students and educators of various disciplines.

The purpose of Herodotus has always been to provide people with more information. One of the ways this can be facilitated is through user participation. It is our sincere wish that regular users contribute by carefully inputting information on more films, so that we can make this a community-driven app with a high-quality database. This will increase how beneficial Herodotus is to everyone.
